**Tester**: meeeaCH

Portmaster page of the game: [LINK](https://portmaster.games/detail.html?name=doom3)

**I wasn't able to make it run, it crashes every time it starts to load a map.**


**Attention** this game needs the patched game files. More info here: [link](https://github.com/dhewm/dhewm3/issues/133)

**CrossMix-OS installation:**
1. Open Portmaster and navigate to **"All Ports"**.
2. Look for **Doom 3** and install it.
3. Close Portmaster, power off your device and connect your SD card to your PC.
4. Copy all **pak** files from your **Doom 3** installation to **"./Data/ports/doom3/base"** folder and replace everything it wants to.
5. Eject the SD card to safely remove it and put it back in your device.
6. Good luck!
